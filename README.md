# Wordpress Plugin for IMDb

With the Imdb auto score plugin, a wordpress author can link to titles on imdb
and display their score and plot by wrapping the title in [imdb][/imdb].

Example:

I really enjoyed [imdb]Man in Black 2[/imdb], you should watch it.

Output:

    <p>I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120912" target="_blank" title="Agent J needs help so he is sent to find Agent K and restore his memory.">Man in Black 2 <span class="ias_score">(5.7)</span></a>, you should watch it.</p>
